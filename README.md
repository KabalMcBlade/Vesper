# Vesper
Render Engine Using the Vulkan API

This engine was created from scratch to explore the Vulkan API and learn more about this modern graphics API. I am not a rendering or engine programmer, so please bear that in mind!

> "Vesper" means evening in Latin

The main and important distinction between this engine and many others is that it is entirely powered by my own [ECS](https://github.com/KabalMcBlade/ECS-API) library. 
When I say "fully," I mean every part of it: objects to be rendered must have a vertex and/or an index buffer component assigned, just to name one example


## Installation Notes

### Inclusion and relative paths

This project uses vma and glm (for now). Both of them have been referenced from VulkanSDK, so for a path point of view, you should have:<br />
C:\VulkanSDK\{version}\Include\glm<br />
C:\VulkanSDK\{version}\Include\vma<br />
which in my case {version} is 1.3.261.1<br />
<br />
This is not mandatory but avoid you to add or change various paths in the project files.

### Linking

Currently the project is set as dynamic library DLL, but can be built as static library LIB if you'd like.<br />
The different settings for linkage are, in Windows and Visual Studio 2022:<br />
<br />
- Dynamic Library:
  - Vesper Engine
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd) 
    - Preprocessor macro to add: ECS_DLL_EXPORT;VESPERENGINE_DLL_EXPORT;
  - Viewer or any other executable
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd) 
    - Preprocessor macro to add: ECS_DLL_IMPORT;VESPERENGINE_DLL_IMPORT;
- Static Library:
  - Vesper Engine
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)
  - Viewer or Any executable
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)

### Features

- ECS core architecture
- Latest Vulkan API support
- Automatic support for both bindless and standard resource binding (textures and buffers)
- Phong shading pipeline for opaque rendering
- Phong shading pipeline for transparent rendering
- PBR shading pipeline for opaque rendering
- PBR shading pipeline for transparent rendering
- Integrated support for push constants (pre-allocated 128-byte layout) and specialization constants
- PushConstants function allows injecting push constants without rebinding the global or bindless pipeline
- Extendable render pipeline architecture (see the Viewer using CustomOpaqueRenderSystem and CustomTransparentRenderSystem, which apply per-object push constants without additional bindings)
- Skybox supports both standard and HDR formats (float32 and float16), with projection types including Equirectangular, Cubemap, Hemisphere, Parabolic, and LatLongCubemap.
- Point Lights, Spot Lights and Directional Lights supported.

## Screenshots

I will post screenshots here as new features are added and when thereâ€™s something significant to show.

Fourth and Fifth render from the engine: PBR loaded, and featuring a skybox in HDR, one Directional Light and random Spot and Point Lights moving in the scene.
