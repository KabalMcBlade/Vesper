# Vesper
Render Engine Using the Vulkan API

This engine was created from scratch to explore the Vulkan API and learn more about this modern graphics API. I am not a rendering or engine programmer, so please bear that in mind!

> "Vesper" means evening in Latin

The main and important distinction between this engine and many others is that it is entirely powered by my own [ECS](https://github.com/KabalMcBlade/ECS-API) library. 
When I say "fully," I mean every part of it: objects to be rendered must have a vertex and/or an index buffer component assigned, just to name one example


## Installation Notes

### Inclusion and relative paths

This project uses vma and glm (for now). Both of them have been referenced from VulkanSDK, so for a path point of view, you should have:<br />
C:\VulkanSDK\{version}\Include\glm<br />
C:\VulkanSDK\{version}\Include\vma<br />
which in my case {version} is 1.3.261.1<br />
<br />
This is not mandatory but avoid you to add or change various paths in the project files.

### Linking

Currently the project is set as dynamic library DLL, but can be built as static library LIB if you'd like.<br />
The different settings for linkage are, in Windows and Visual Studio 2022:<br />
<br />
- Dynamic Library:
  - Vesper Engine
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd) 
    - Preprocessor macro to add: ECS_DLL_EXPORT;VESPERENGINE_DLL_EXPORT;
  - Viewer or any other executable
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd) 
    - Preprocessor macro to add: ECS_DLL_IMPORT;VESPERENGINE_DLL_IMPORT;
- Static Library:
  - Vesper Engine
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)
  - Viewer or Any executable
    - Runtime Library: Multi-threaded (/MT) **OR** Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)

### Features

- ECS core
- Latest Vulkan API
- Automatically support bindless and standard binding resource (textures and buffers)
- Opaque pipeline render system (for now just this)
- Push constant and specialization constant support integrated
- Extendable render pipeline

## Screenshots

I will post screenshots here as new features are added and when thereâ€™s something significant to show.
